Fabhelpers
==========

Helper functions and tasks for fabric.  This library is just a collection of helper functions
for fabric that I use repeatedly in projects.  Right now its just a place for me to store these
helpers but if there is intrest I'll place it on PyPI.  To use install with pip pointing to this
repo and import the fabfile into your fabfile.
